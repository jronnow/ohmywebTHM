We already know this is a web server, but before we poke around in our browser let's set our trusty nmap to run while we take a look.

nmap -vvvv -A -oN scan -p- $TARGET

While that runs, let's hop over to port 80. The web page just says "It works!" and the page source doesn't reveal much of use either.

Time to enumerate web directories:

gobuster dir -u $TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 64

This reveals two things: /cgi-bin/ (which is forbidden) and /index.html which is just the homepage.

So far our nmap scan has revealed port 80 (duh) and port 22. Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait. I didn't tell nmap to be fast and aggressive, so it's gonna be a little while longer before I can see details on which versions of these services are running. In the meantime, let's see what Nikto's got to say.

nikto -host $TARGET

Looks like we've got an Apache 2.4.49 server. Let's plug that into searchsploit and see what we get.

There's a PHP exploit that allows for RCE via the cgi-bin directory. If that's not promising, I don't know what is. Let's grab it and stick it in our current directory.

searchsploit -m 29290

TBC...
